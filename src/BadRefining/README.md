# Bad Refining

This mod makes the game *harder* by reducing the amount of ore you get from refineries.

Additionally it makes it impossible to refine stone using large refineries (basic refineries must be used).

Most of the changes made by this mod are configurable (see later in the description)

This is similar to some parts of the Survival Less Likely mod.


## Full list of changes made by this mod:

- All refining reduced to 40% yield
- Stone refining reduced to 30% yield
- Stone refining in a survival kit reduced to 20% yield
- Uranium refining reduced to 10% yield
- Large refineries cannot refine stone
- IcetoGas ratio for Oxygen production reduced to 0.1 from 10
- Power consumption of all production blocks increased by 2.5x
- Double output of oxygen farms


## Configurability

Most of the changes made by this mod can be configured to whatever values you like; see `%AppData%\SpaceEngineers\Saves\<Your Save>\Storage\Bad Refining_BadRefiningMod\Settings.xml` after starting a new map with the mod loaded.
